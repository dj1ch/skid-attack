# Skid Attack
The fake hacking script that will make a skid regret their decisions
#
### Intro to the concept
Hi, I'm [@dj1ch](https://github.com/dj1ch), the main devloper of this script. I am, at the writing of this script, 14 years of age. Especially in this time, hacking has become a buzzword to a lot of people. It is commonly seen in pop culture and seen as something more negative than positive. A common reason for this is kids. And by kids, I mean kids. The ones that will harass you and will attempt to 'DDOS' you and 'Grab your IP'. This script here pretends to be one of the tools that they might use, being somewhat skid friendly.

### So what does it do exactly...?
It will act as a python script to be ran. If they run it, the menu will have many items that may appeal to those who want to quickly 'hack' somebody. Each menu item selected comes with an attack that will go against them. An example of this is the DDOS attack. In simple terms, a DDOS attack is a Directed-Denial-of-Service. This can be something like deleting all of a victim's files, or taking down their wifi so it cannot be used. In this case, instead of attacking the IP they want, it will just ping their computer to death, along with removing their system32 folder(if they are on windows), or the root directory(if they are on linux or maybe macOS). That's a DDOS attack that essentially went against themselves. Hopefully they don't know python. If they somehow figure out what this does, I applaud them for their effort(sorta).

### Note
DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT ON YOUR OWN SYSTEM!!!! FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR OWN FILES AMONG OTHER THINGS, DO NOT RUN THE SCRIPT!!!! IT WILL DELETE AND BRICK YOUR COMPUTER'S OPERATING SYSTEM, EVEN REMOVING THE BOOT ENTRY DEPENDING ON THE OS!!!

I am not responsible for any of the damage caused by this, and I am not going to help you recover any device data, even if you beg to me. No exceptions.
